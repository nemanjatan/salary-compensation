# Chain of Responsibility Implementation in Java üîó

This project showcases the Chain of Responsibility design pattern in Java, focusing on a scenario where a salary adjustment request passes through various levels of management approval. It demonstrates how to decouple request senders and receivers by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into key packages and classes reflecting the Chain of Responsibility pattern:

- `model`: Contains `SalaryAdjustmentRequest` class representing the request with employee details and adjustment amount.
- `handler`: Contains `CompensationHandler` interface and its implementations (`TeamLeadHandler`, `LineManagerHandler`, `HRManager`) representing different levels of management.
- `Main`: The entry point of the application that sets up the chain and initiates the request processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or later
- Your favorite IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

### Running the Application üèÉ

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` class.

This setup simulates a salary adjustment request being processed through different handlers in the chain, demonstrating the pattern's effectiveness in managing approval workflows.

### Simulating Salary Adjustment Requests

To simulate processing a salary adjustment request, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate handlers for each level of management.
2. Link handlers in order of their hierarchy.
3. Create a `SalaryAdjustmentRequest` object with sample data.
4. Pass the request to the initial handler in the chain.

### Example Code Snippet

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Handler teamLead = new TeamLeadHandler();
        Handler lineManager = new LineManagerHandler();
        Handler hrManager = new HRManagerHandler();

        teamLead.setNextHandler(lineManager);
        lineManager.setNextHandler(hrManager);

        SalaryAdjustmentRequest request = new SalaryAdjustmentRequest("John Doe", 3200, 15);
        teamLead.handleRequest(request);
    }
}
```
